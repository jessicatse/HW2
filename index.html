    <text>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, found north of the equator. 
        Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming</text>
